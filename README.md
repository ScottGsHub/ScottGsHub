- 👋 Hi, I’m @ScottGsHub
- 👀 I’m a product manager and I just play with GitHub a bit to learn just a little about code and practice some new things. 
- Not trying to be a 'real' dev or anything... just playing around a bit.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little bit of everything. Refreshed on JavaScript a bit, and practicing with some SQL.
- May try to get some Python basics down.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Nothing right now.
- 📫 How to reach me: No real need.
